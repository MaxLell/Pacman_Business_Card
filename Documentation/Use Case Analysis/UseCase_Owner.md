# User Experience during the Tradeshow
Scenario 1: a business card is handed over from the owner to the client
Scenario 2: A business card's information is scanned. By that the QR Code is meant, but the business card remains in the hands of the owner.

# User Experience before the tradeshow.
- The owner needs to know whether this card is fully functional and whether this card can be handed over confidently.
- The owner therefore needs to know the battery status, and whether all features on the card are working as intended.
- The owner wants to avoid that the "presentation" goes wrong. This must not happen. This might result in a customer being lost.
