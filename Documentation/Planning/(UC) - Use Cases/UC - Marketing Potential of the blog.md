- The business card shall provide as many touch-points as possible to potential clients
    - Writing about it on a blog
    - Talking about it in a release video (and sharing this with Hackaday, Golem and Heise, Make)
- The business card shall create as many touch points as possible. -> More exposure -> more traction
