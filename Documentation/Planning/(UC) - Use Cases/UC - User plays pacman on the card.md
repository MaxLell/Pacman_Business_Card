# 1 Owner wants to be able to verify proper functionality before handing out the card
- The owner needs to know whether this card is fully functional and whether this card can be handed over confidently.
- The owner therefore needs to know the battery status, and whether all features on the card are working as intended.
- The owner wants to avoid that the "presentation" goes wrong. This must not happen. This might result in a customer being lost. 

# 2 User Experience on a Hacker-Con or on a MakerFaire
- For this it shall be possible to use the business card as a badge. Therefore it shall be possible to magnetically mount the card on my sleeve.
- I will also need to add some LEDs for that matter, so that it sparks even more attention and kicks off a conversation.
- Therefore the business card shall not be too heavy, so that I can carry it around on a piece of clothing
- The battery shall last for at least a day with the enabled Blinking
