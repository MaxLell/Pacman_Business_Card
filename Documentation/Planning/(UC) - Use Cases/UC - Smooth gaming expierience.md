The thing that is to be avoided:

- Lagging gameplay experience when the user tries to play the game
	- This means that the Buttons need to be captured within 20msec
	- This means that the display renders including all other activities the game with around 30fps

- From powering on the device to playing the game it shall only take 1 Second
