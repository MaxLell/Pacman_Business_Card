- I want to learn how to plan my activities and keep track of them
- For that matter I need to:
	1. Figure out the technical challenges
	2. Plan tasks
	3. Give these tasks a time budget (and keep track on that)
	4. Work on the tickets
	5. Review whether the tickets are done in time and whether my plan works out
	6. Adjust the plans and the budgets

- I also need to break down the Project into several subcomponents and MVPs which I can tackle one by one.
