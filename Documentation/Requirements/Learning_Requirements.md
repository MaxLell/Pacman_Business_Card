# Learning Requirements
## Technical topics
- I want to learn new programming languages and work on a fairly complex software and hardware problem
- I want to learn how to port ML Systems from the host to the target
- I want to familiarize myself with build systems and how to set these things up. 

## Process Topics
- I want to approach the project in a more structured approach, so that I can pick up and leave the project at any time being and restart again, when I have more time at hand.
- I want to be able to work in smaller increments. In the past picking up a project was very tedious, since I had to on-board myself again into the current situation, figure a new solution and then implement this. I would like to split this appart more, so that I can work in smaller increments for that matter.
- This project shall serve as the foundation of starting a blog and creating content for said blog.
