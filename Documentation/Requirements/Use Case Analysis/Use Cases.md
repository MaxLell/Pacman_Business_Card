# User Experience of the player
This is about the user experience that the player has, when using the business card to play the game.

## Power Off - State
- The display shows the contact information and a QR Code to my Home-Page

## user plays the game
### From Power-Off to playing a game
- User presses the "Power-On" Button on the edge of the board (the switch is slightly pulled in so that it does not get triggered by accident)
- The system powers on and my name comes flowing in (like the Nintendo Logo on a Gameboy)
- The system puts the user into a menu, in which he can start a new game
- when the game was started the ghosts are only spawned 2 seconds later, so that the user has time to familiarize himself with the environment
- The user then plays the game.

### User wins the game
- This is an arcade title - You can't beat pacman - it just gets increasingly hard. 

### User loses the game (lost his 3 Lives)
- A game over animation is displayed on the screen
- The current score is collected and the user can enter his credentials with the controls in order to enter his records in the high-score system. If the current score was achieved with the help of AI, then this is added in the User-Tag
- This high-score is saved permanently.
- The user is moved back to the initial menu

### User triggers AI
- The respective LED under the capacitive switch shall start to pulsate
- the display shows a screen on which can be read: "Skynet taking over". Toggle AI button to switch of the AI
- Then the User Controls are disabled
- The AI plays until it loses, or until the user takes over again.

### User powers off the device after playing the game
- System just resets itself and shuts itself down.

## User charges the device
- An led next to the USB-C Port shall indicate that the battery is charging.
- the display shall show the current time of the day and the current date (including contact information)
- If the player presses the power button, then the game is launched

### User wants to have a functional device, which is not only paper weight
- The user wants the time and date to be displayed (almost like a pocket watch)
- The user powers on the device. 
- In the menu the user can select: Display current time (including contact information)
- The system shows the current system time

# User Experience during the Tradeshow
## A business card is handed over from the owner to the client
- the owner hands of the business card
- the client puts them in a bag (The system shall power itself off, after a timeout, so that the battery is not fully drained)
- a couple of days later the client takes the business card out of his bag and restarts the business card. The business card shall still be functional then.

## A business card's information is scanned. 
- By that the QR Code is meant, but the business card remains in the hands of the owner.

# User Experience before the tradeshow.
- The owner needs to know whether this card is fully functional and whether this card can be handed over confidently.
- The owner therefore needs to know the battery status, and whether all features on the card are working as intended.
- The owner wants to avoid that the "presentation" goes wrong. This must not happen. This might result in a customer being lost. 

# User Experience on a Hacker-Con or on a MakerFaire
- For this it shall be possible to use the business card as a badge. Therefore it shall be possible to magnetically mount the card on my sleeve.
- I will also need to add some LEDs for that matter, so that it sparks even more attention and kicks off a conversation.
- Therefore the business card shall not be too heavy, so that I can carry it around on a piece of clothing
- The battery shall last for at least a day
