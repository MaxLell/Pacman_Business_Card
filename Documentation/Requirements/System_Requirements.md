# System Requirements
- The card shall transmit the contact information of its creator.
    - Name
    - Email Addresses
    - LinkedIn
    - Blog
- The user shall be able to play pacman on the card
- The user shall be able to flip a switch to have the AI take over the current game and trash the ghosts instead of him.
- The user shall be able to put in his credentials for a high-score.
- When the AI was used to create a new high-score, then this is also recorded in the Tag line.
- The business card shall have roughly the size of a credit card.
- It shall be possible to use the business card without the need of external power supply
- It shall be possible to charge the business card with USB-C (so the battery shall not be disposable)
- When the card is connected to a permanent power supply then the system shall display the current time and date in an analog format. Furthermore my name is to be displayed there. (Potentially my QR Code every once in a while)
- A fully charged business card shall last for a week. Tradeshows typically last between 3-5 days. Since you do not want to charge 20 Business cards every evening in the hotel, there needs to be a better way.
- The business card shall not be activated by accident (so when the card is in a pocket)
