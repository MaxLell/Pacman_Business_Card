# Stakeholder Requirements
## Developer
- It shall be possible to develop this system on a Mac, a Linux computer and on Windows. This comes due to the fact, that I am working with a lot of different potential build environments
- It shall be possible to build and test the project with as little effort as possible. It is not acceptable to run lenghty commands in the terminal in order to install all the tools, nor to test or build the project.

## Player (User)
- The game shall start within less then 1 Seconds. It shall not be annoying for the player

## Person who hands out the card
- Shall have the ressources available to talk knowledgeable about this project.
- The business card needs to be as flat as possible so that 5-10 business can be transported comfortably in the pocket of your trousers.

## Desk-User
- The system shall not only serve as a business card, but rather then that it shall also serve as a small clock which you can place on your desk (next to your screen). For this feature to work - the card needs to be connected permanently to a power supply.
- When the analog clock is shown then also my name needs to pop up eventually
- Once a week the business card shall at random (but within the timeframe of 10-12 and between 13-17) play an AI Pacman game. (Just to shake things up a little)

## Marketing Requirements
- The business card shall be salvaged in order to grow my online presence and to have something to talk about on my blog.
- The business card shall provide as many touch-points as possible to potential clients
    - Writing about it on a blog
    - Talking about it in a release video (and sharing this with Hackaday, Golem and Heise, Make)
- The business card shall create as many touch points as possible. -> More exposure -> more traction
    - It shall have exhibition when being handed out / or scanned for that matter
    - It shall be placed on people's desk and to provide them a constant reminder of my everlasting love.
