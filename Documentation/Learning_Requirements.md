# Learning Requirements
- I want to use CPP and Python for the development. This serves to be more competitive on the job market
- I want to create an automatic build system in order to pull this off. 
- I want to learn to work outside of an IDE in order to implement this project. I want to control the compilation, testing and debugging Process.
