# 1 Weeks of coding ...
First things first - how shall I actually get started?

From experience I know that I do not want to dive right into the implementation. Did you ever hear the quote: "Weeks of developing can save you hours of planning?". Well I did it before. Initially progress was great, I thought: "Uhhh so much code and it does its thing"... later I realized that the software was terribly architectured and poorly planned out. I was not able to extend nor maintain it without significant effort. The speed of development was gone and the rush of positive emotions too. 

So rather then repeating this dreadful experience, I am going to do a bit of upfront planning in order to mitigate the largest roadblocks

# 2 Problems as cubes

(INSERT Image of a cube figure here)

When I have no clue how to get even started I imagine the problem to be like like a cube with multiple faces. By looking at the problem at hand from different angles, I can learn much more. Furthermore I can also see how problems might be interconnected

So for the purpose of planning a generic problem, I choose perspectives from the following list. 
- Users: Who are the users?
- User Stories: What do these users want to achieve when they interact with the device. 
- User Cases: How are the respective users interacting with the device? 
- Requirements: What is to be achieved so that the project is a success? 
- Timeline: How long will it take to achieve it? 
- Phases: Can this project be structured into makro-phases? And what phases are there?
- Milestones: What milestones are to be achieved for each phase?
- Costs: How pricy is it? Is it 1000€ or 20€
- Design Sketches: How shall the product look like in its physical form?

These are more then 6 sides, I know, but you get the idea. By looking from different perspectives you learn a lot more. Usually I iterate multiple times, since the insights that I find on one side usually also affects my understanding from the other sides and then I add these findings in, to then start again. Eventually you run out of new ideas and thoughts. This is when I stop.

As it is with every complex problem, I am not using all these perspectives all the time. 

Since now I understand how it works, what it does under which circumstance and why, I can go and reverse engineer the device from that mental picture and bring it into reality.

In the next chapter, I am going to apply this to the business card
