First things first - how shall I actually get started?

Trust me, you do not want to jump right in. Did you ever hear the Quote: "Weeks of developing can save you hours of planning?" So this is what we do. We plan. But how and what is to be planned for this project?

When I have no clue how to get even started I imagine the problem to be like like a cube with multiple faces. Each side contains some specific information of the thing you are trying to create. 

So in order to figure out exactly what I am trying to build, I am looking at the idea (cube) from its different sides:
- Stakeholders: Who uses the device?
- User Cases: How are the respective users interacting with the device? I am usually writing some Pseudo-Code that lists what happens when the user does this and that.
- User Stories: What do the users want to achieve when they interact with the device. 
- Requirements: What is to be achieved so that the project is a success? This is similar to User Stories and Use-Cases but I find it technically more precise.
- Timeline: How long will it take to achieve it? 
- MVPs: What are the minimal valuable products? What is the minimum valuable outcome that already shows some success to the user
- Milestones: What milestones are to be achieved? 
- Costs: How pricy is it? Is it 1000€ or 20€
- Design Sketches: How shall the product look like in its physical form?

These are more then 6 sides, I know, but you get the idea. By looking from different perspectives you learn a lot more. Usually I iterate multiple times, since the insights that I find on one side usually also affects my understanding from the other sides

Since now I understand how it works, what it does under which circumstance and why, I can go and reverse engineer the device from that mental picture.

So for example the Pacman AI Business card is roughly supposed to look like this:

And its the Use-Case for when a person plays with it looks like this: [[UC - User plays pacman on the card]] which is linked to this [[US - Playing Pacman]] 

From there I can derive the requirements ([[Req - Index]]) and assemble an MVP, which goes like this [[MS - Pacman Game can be played on the host]] as a first step.
