# The Project's origin story
TLDR: Who in their right mind would spend this much time into designing such a pacman AI business card? This article lays out, why I am doing it nonetheless

## Why Pacman?

Once upon a time I taught myself to code and I figured that a good challenge to sharpen my skills is trying to implement my own games. I figured that pacman would be an interesting game, since I also enjoy playing this and it seemed to be quite complex.
Well back then, I tried to punch way beyond my weight-class and I failed horribly. I spent a month getting stuck and stuck again on how to implement this (I forced myself to come up with my own implementation). I got stuck on everything: 
- I tried to develop the Code with TDD (I barely understood the concept). 
- I tried to come up with my own software architecture - I heard the Term MVP (Model View Control) Architecture once and therefore everything under the sun had to be implemented that way ... 
- I coded for 8h straight without planning or knowing what I was coding. So I created so much stuff that I had to delete eventually again.
Needless to say, I set myself up to fail and I was not able to finish the game. However I learned a lot, most importantly: I had to learn a lot more to be able to create this game from scratch.

## Where does the idea from the AI come from?

I really enjoy systems that are able to solve problems by themselves. Back at school I learned about a device called "centrifugal governor" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrifugal_governor). This device controlled the fuel intake for steam engine. The faster the engine spun, the more the "governor" became active and reduced the intake of the engine. This is a classic example of a self regulating system. Usually you would have a person standing there, looking on screens and having a dial in his hand to slow down the engine again. But now this can be done automatically, by the machine itself forever (ignore the maintenance part here)?. Somebody managed to put the smarts of his brains into a physical form that is here to stay, without the person being there again. For me such self regulating systems are pure genius. 
This is the reason I became more interested in the field of AI, and especially in systems that regulate themselves. Such is the case for the Pacman AI Game. An agent which learns to resolve this dynamic problem by himself. Furthermore I also found somebody who already had a similar idea and implemented that: (Code Bullets Pacman AI: https://youtu.be/QpyHYRBKy8U?si=XPdFzpJ-v2LpDVyd)

## Why a business card?

I am quite active follower of the hackaday badges (https://hackaday.io/list/161122-conference-badges) where people create small embedded systems that run on conference badges for their hacker cons. These people create small badges, which they can carry around so that they have something to talk about when they meet each other. This business card also follows a similar approach. I use it as a talking point which I can write about online and which I can show off on trade-shows, MakerFaires or conferences.
Furthermore I now can bring the Pacman AI into the physical world. 
Another inspiration I have for that matter is the example which is given by (Embedded Business Card: https://youtu.be/y-lWarLUhfg?si=Mu2mJN31iRo75-cz). I really like the experience he describes in this regard. 
Additionally the Arduboy project also showed me that enjoying an arcade game on such a tiny system is definitly possible. 

## Why not build something that is actually useful?

For me the primary objective of running this project is learning. It is a vehicle that brings me from "little-knowledge-land" to "more-knowledge-land". And since all traveling is more about the journey then reaching the destination (according to some inspirational quotes), this is what I am going to do. I am enjoying the ride. This is in stark contrast to how my typical development for commercial products works. There it is more about finding the best and most efficient solution for the minimum available time. This is a very efficient approach, but I also would like to have more opportunities of exploring. If you have time to stop and enjoy the view on the side, it makes for a more scenic ride.
