First things first - how shall I actually get started?

Trust me, you do not want to jump right into the implementation. Did you ever hear the quote: "Weeks of developing can save you hours of planning?". I burned myself heavily with this before, so this is not what we are going to do.

So instead of firing up all the cool tools that I can use, I will first sit down and thing what we are actually building.

When I have no clue how to get even started I imagine the problem to be like like a cube with multiple faces. Each face contains some specific information of the thing you are trying to create. You look at one side, extract some information and then you look at the next. By taking a new perspective and looking at the problem from many different perspectives you slowly but surely learn what it is that you want to create.

So for the purpose of planning of the current project, I am looking at the "idea" from these different perspectives:
- Users: Who are the users?
- User Stories: What do these users want to achieve when they interact with the device. 
- User Cases: How are the respective users interacting with the device? 
- Requirements: What is to be achieved so that the project is a success? 
- Timeline: How long will it take to achieve it? 
- Phases: Can this project be structured into makro-phases? And what phases are there?
- Milestones: What milestones are to be achieved for each phase?
- Costs: How pricy is it? Is it 1000€ or 20€
- Design Sketches: How shall the product look like in its physical form?

These are more then 6 sides, I know, but you get the idea. By looking from different perspectives you learn a lot more. Usually I iterate multiple times, since the insights that I find on one side usually also affects my understanding from the other sides and then I add these findings in, to then start again. Eventually you run out of new ideas and thoughts. This is when I stop.

Since now I understand how it works, what it does under which circumstance and why, I can go and reverse engineer the device from that mental picture and bring it into reality.

So for example the Pacman AI Business card is roughly supposed to look like this:

And its the Use-Case for when a person plays with it looks like this: [[UC - User plays pacman on the card]] which is linked to this [[US - Playing Pacman]] 

From there I can derive the requirements ([[Req - Index]]) and proceed with diving deeper into the first phase: [[MS - Phase 1 - A host beginning]]

This will be discussed in the next article:
