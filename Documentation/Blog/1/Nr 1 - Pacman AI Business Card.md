# Pacman AI Business Card
Building a physical business card on which either you or a Neural Network play Pacman

New year, new ... project - I guess. As I grow more mature as an embedded systems engineer, I find it more and more helpful to build a project for the sake of my own education and sharpening of skills.

I do not find it motivating to go through tutorials and read through books just for the sake of doing it. To which end am I doing this? And how do I actually know that I learned the thing?

Having a concrete problem against which I can compare my efforts against, answers these questions. In this way, I am able to close the feedback loop and also check that I actually understood and learned the topic. Without testing your skills you simply do not know how good you are.

So now you might ask, what is the project about? Why Pacman? Is it the thing that is described in the title???

Yep, you are goddamn right about that.

For this project, I want to create a physical business card, that I can hand out on trade shows, meetups ... (in-person events) on which you can play Pacman on a small display. Furthermore I enjoy seeing systems solving problems by themselves. For that matter I want to add an additional button on the card, which toggles an "AI" which beats the crap out of the ghosts, if the user chooses to.

Pacman is a fairly complex game for that matter, and since this is also a learning project for me, I do not want to build another cookie-cutter project. For the sake of stretching myself, I want to move away from my home ground (the C-Programming language) to Python and C++ for the implementation (Along the way, I will most likely need to familiarize myself with many more things).

Later I also want to create a physical product - somethings that I can actually hand out - PEOPLE WILL BE SO IMPRESSED. Or maybe not. But still I learned a lot ;)

This blog series shall serve as my record in the endeavor of building this thing. I will basically record all the steps that I am taking and my reasoning behind it. You can breathe over my sholder observing every step, I am doing. So far I did not find a lot of well documented embedded software projects, which take you all the way from the initial small beginnings to the very end of the shipment of the product, and I always wanted to follow along such projects - this is why I am creating one for myself.

In the next blog posts, I will go over my process of refining my ideas and get started, without overthinking to much. I will capture how I come up with requirements, architecture - (and how much of that is enough, because you can definitely over- or under-do it).

Up until, see you around fellas :)
