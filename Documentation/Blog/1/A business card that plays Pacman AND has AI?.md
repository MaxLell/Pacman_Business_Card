# 1 A business card with AI you say? Shut up and take my money!
TLDR: Building a physical business card on which either you or a Neural Network play Pacman

(MEME IMAGE OF "SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY").

Soooo here we go again. Another project idea hits the floor and waits to be implemented. This project is about creating a business card for myself on which you can either play pacman for youself or you have an AI that plays it for you.
I mainly do this for the sake of learning.

I learn best, when I build stuff, that I am not yet able to build. Such is the case for this project. It is an immense challenge for me. In the persuit of doing so, I will need to learn new programming languages, I will learn how to build software more on a host platform (My background is on the low level things of Microcontrollers). And when I am done, I will hopefully have something that I am proud of handing out.

In the upcoming chapter, I will discuss what inspired me to implement this project
