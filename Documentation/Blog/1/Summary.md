ðŸš€ Pacman AI Business Card

Iâ€™m building a business card with a small display where users can play Pacmanâ€”or let an AI take over. This project is a hands-on way to sharpen my embedded systems skills, explore Python and C++, and tackle real-world challenges.

Motivated by purposeful learning, Iâ€™ll document every step, from idea to a physical product, sharing insights into design, requirements, and development.

If that sounds interesting, please follow along
