FIRST STOP: BUILD SYSTEM

> 97% of all software problems stem from premature optimization

*Next I need a build system. Something lightweight. As with all topics you can go all the way and there. There are jobs out there in our field nothing else but working on these things in order to optimize build systems for ci/cd tasks*

*As for this project, I also want to learn build systems. It is such an important concept in our field. You need to build your software on several different platforms: the host computer, the build server, the embedded target, run unit tests, run integration tests, generate the output reports ... Many of these things can be done in a build system. However, as we know from peter parker: With great power - great responsibility*
