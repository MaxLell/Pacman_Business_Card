# 1 File Organization
When I was starting out, I was utterly confused on how to structure such a project EVEN in a file scope. I then took an apprenticeship in a small company that was very successful at what they did and they basically structured their files in the following order. This structure worked fine for their needs (small to medium-sized projects) and since this project is likely the same size of a project, I will stick to that. Simple but effective.

This is the folder structure I am going to use on my Github Repository.

```

There might be additional folders being created in the Major folders (Documentation, Software, Electronics, Mechanics), but this can already be used as a good start.

# 2 Development Tools
The documentation is generated and maintained in Obsidian. This helps with the internal Links of the project. 

The Software is going to be developed in VSCode

# 3 Project Management
The Project management is going to be done on my Github Repo. Github provides some handy tools to manage such projects - also with issue tracking and a lot of stuff, that goes far beyond what I need + it is free (So I am the product being sold ...)
