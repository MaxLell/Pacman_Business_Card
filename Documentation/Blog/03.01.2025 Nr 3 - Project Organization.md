# 1 File Organization
This is only a short section about file organization, and how I intend to keep my project organized. This answers where I will place all the outputs, that I am about to create.

This is the folder structureI am going to use on my Github Repo
```
Pacman Business Card
├── Documentation
│   ├── Requirements and Use Cases
│   ├── Architecture Plots
│   │   ├── Software Architecture
│   │   └── Electronics Architecture
│   ├── Project Inspiration
│   └── ...
├── Software
│   ├── Source Code
│   └── CI/CD
├── Electronics
│   ├── CAD Files
│   └── Manufacturing Files
└── Mechanics
    ├── CAD Files
    └── Manufacturing Files
```

For the development files (Software, Electronics, Mechanics) it is very common to place them into a version control system. However I also want to include the files from the documentation. These things are usually handled in systems like confluence, but for a single person show it should suffice to not go into the lengths of putting this on confluence, but rather treat it as regular text files which are also to be put in a version control system (same as code files).

I will place all the outputs into the git repo.
# 2 Time and Effort Planning
- This will be done on Github by using the project feature there.
