Stick with me, this a bit of a philosophical take, on why it is fine to be "dumb".

The brain is really good at cracking problems. But it is not good at holding several pieces of information in itself. This is where the writing really comes in handy. You offload the brain with the different thoughts and have it only run the computation. This is why I personally enjoy writing so much. I can think about more complex issues, since I am not keeping my head busy with holding all these parallel threads at once.

I think you can also see this at play, when you see the rule from clean code: "A function should not be longer then 20 lines of code".
Same comes true for the McCabe Complexity index, that roughly says, that a function that does more then 10 things should be refactored. The computer does not mind a function that does this many things, but the person that writes and maintains this code, can't process these many tasks in parallel.

So this is why I write. I am fine to be dumb and to realize my personal limits in this regard. I can't hold these many thoughts in my head in parallel and be efficient with cracking one problem at a time. This is why I offload it onto paper, my tablet, written notes on my blog, sketches ...

At the end it is not important how "intelligent" you are, but what you can create. Intelligence is just a tool.
