More planning... yet again. However, even though I am growing impatient, I am moving further towards towards starting to produce. I do not count planning and architecture as a real output. It is necessary, but it is not an output per se. It is something which you only need for development, but it will remain hidden under the sea level of the iceberg, when only the tip is standing out.

Anyway. This milestone is about building the game. For that I need:
1. A solid understanding of the game -> Check -> see [[Software Architecture - Pacman Game]]
2. A build system -> To be done (Next article)
3. The Implementation of the game itself -> Again to be done (After I can build a hello world example)

In the upcoming chapter, I will have a look into the build system. This again is something that I am not very familiar with.
