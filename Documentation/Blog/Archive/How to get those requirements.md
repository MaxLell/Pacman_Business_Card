# 1 How to extract Requirements
Requirements are the ground truth of what the thing you are trying to build shall actually do and how it shall look like. So we start with a vague idea: "It needs to be pretty" - the corresponding requirements could be (this is just an example):
- height: 10cm
- width: 2cm
- length: 3cm
- material: PLA plastic
- Color: green
I just described a block of plastic which some would describe as pretty, but this is not important now. Basically requirements give you what you mean exactly, so that you or others can build it. It is a specification of the term "pretty product" in technical terms.

Applied to the current task at hand with the Pacman Business card that means the following.
We already did some preliminary crafting of stories, just to figure out whether the concept makes sense and whether it is realistic that this is feasible to develop. Now we are moving one step further into getting into the weeds of the details.

So the way, I do it: I craft high level User Stories (the what), then I supplement them with use-cases (how) and then I come up with Requirements (what), which translate both the user stories and the use cases into something that I can actually build. There can be a lot of formality for this process (especially when you look into the realm of safety critical product development), but for this tinker project, we can keep it light.

To give you an example how that might look like:
