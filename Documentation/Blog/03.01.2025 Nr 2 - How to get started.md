So now the target is clear: I want a business card on which the user shall be able to play pac-man. This is all nice and dandy, but now what? Where shall I even start?

I try to refine the product in a systematic way: The way how I approach this works as follows: 
- I want to know how the product is used.
- I want to know how the product shall look like. 

So how can I learn how the product is used?
I usually create multiple personas / stakeholders / users and then imagine how they might use the business card. By doing this, I can shine light on things that I would otherwise not have anticipated. I go through through a couple of examples how these things might play out. What I am doing is basically creating a vision of the product and then I reverse-engineer in the upcoming sections in ever more detail how this needs to be implemented in order to fulfill this vision.

How can I learn how the product shall look like?
For that I am doodling a lot on my tablet and create a couple of visual mocks. The current version, I will persue for the project at the moment looks like as follows.

For answering both these leading questions, I usually go through several iterations. Most often I have the best ideas or answers to these questions, when I am doing something completely different (for example under the shower). 

So now I have a rough understanding of how the device works and how it looks like.
