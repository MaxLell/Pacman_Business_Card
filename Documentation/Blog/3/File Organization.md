# File Organization
This is only a short section about file organization, and how I intend to keep my project organized. This answers where I will place all the outputs, that I am about to create.

When I was starting out, I was utterly confused on how to structure such a project EVEN in a file scope. I then took an apprenticeship in a small company that was very successful at what they did and they basically structured their files in the following order. This structure worked fine for their needs (small to medium-sized projects) and since this project is likely the same size of a project, I will stick to that. Simple but effective.

This is the folder structure I am going to use on my Github Repository.
```

├── Electronics
│   ├── CAD Files
│   └── Manufacturing Files
└── Mechanics
    ├── CAD Files
    └── Manufacturing Files
```

There might be additional folders being created in the Major folders (Documentation, Software, Electronics, Mechanics), but this can already be used as a good start.
