You ever heard the term: "Ah never mind, I will just quickly build it myself, rather then using an existing solution"?. I once worked in a project, where the company's toy project was the creation of their own unit test framework. It was buggy, tedious to use and did not make the cut, when we had it compete against the UNITY Test Framework. Eventually this project and its efforts were abandoned for the project and we used UNITY.

So to not reinvent the wheel, I will use an existing template for a build system. For the current time this will be the CppUTest-starter project. It follows a basic folder structure and I tailored it to my needs. This can be found on the following Repo.

Eventually this will need to be expanded to fit all the needs that I have in the project, but in order to keep it light and simple, I will stick to the basics.

I reused the following [Project](https://github.com/jmichaelsturm/cpputest-starter-project-cmake) for that sake
