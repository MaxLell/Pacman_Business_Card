TLDR: Building a physical business card on which either you or a Neural Network play Pacman

![[800.webp]]

This is the first article in a series of articles, in which I am building a business card on which either me or an AI can play the game Pacman

## 0.1 Idea

I want to create a business card, on which 2 artificial intelligence agents fight each other, while I can watch them battle. It is basically a modern-age gladiator fight to the death.

ON THE ONE SIDE WE HAVE:  
THE GHOSTS - Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Clyde - they follow the static set of rules, which is determined by the game logic.  
AND IN THE OTHER CORNER WE HAVE:  
Pacman - it is controllable by a human player, OR by an apex predator AI. You can flip a switch and toggle whether you or the AI plays the current game. I will train the AI on the host computer.

All of this shall be fit to the form factor of a business card. Something like a mini-Gameboy, on which you can witness this conflict in all its glory.

## 0.2 How the sausage is made

When I was starting out, I always wanted to see how the sausage is made for a complex embedded system. By "complex" I don't mean a cookie-cutter project (some LEDs blinking when you press a button), but rather something that has a complex software application and which interfaces with several components. So this is what I am going to do. I will explain how I go from concept (and what I do in this phase) to implementation (and how I do it).

## 0.3 Learning and practice

I usually learn the best, when I have the challenge of building something with it. I don't think that taking one course after the other and sitting in "tutorial hell" serves you any purpose. Its good to start with some theory, but the brain's memory does not work like a computer, where you can just fill in new data and then you can use it. The brain needs practice to connect the theory to something existing. And this is also the reason I am starting this project.

It is an immense challenge for me. Not only will I need to learn new programming languages (Cpp and Python - most likely), I will also need to learn how build-systems work (since most likely the code will need to be developed on multiple hardware platforms). I need to understand how to teach an AI and how to port it to a microcontroller. Besides, I am also learning to write for an audience and to publish this out to the world.

The idea in itself is a bit ridiculous, but so is working out in a gym. From a rational outside perspective it makes no sense, that humans lift weights to just drop them again and repeat. Same is true for this project. I am doing this to practice.

So many new things on the horizon.

At the end this shall be a business card, which I can hand out to potential customers. I think it stands out and it captures the magic machines solving problems by themselves. And this is what this project is all about.

If this is something which you are interested in, please follow along.
