TLDR: Breaking it down from "insurmountable" to "big chunks" to "smaller digestible chunks".

# 1 Breaking it down
Usually when I am done with the planning and evaluation of the project, I feel a bit overwhelmed. 

"There is just so much stuff to be done", "How can I ever get this up and running, I will never finish this?". These are thoughts going through my head in such circumstances. 

The answer to the headline question: 
> "How does one eat an elephant?" -> "Piece by piece". 

So I basically break down the entire device development into different phases. And since these phases do still have too much scope, I further break down the phases into achievable milestones.

Now we do have a small goal, that I can actually achieve in a limited amount of time.

# 2 Applied to the Pacman AI project
So to give you an example on how that looks like for the Pacman AI Business Card: 
The first phase is called "A host beginning" ([[MS - Phase 1 - A host beginning|LINK]]) which is about developing Pacman and its controlling AI on the Host platform. 
The first milestone in this phase is the development of the development of the Pacman Game on the Host [[MS - Pacman Game can be played on the host|LINK]]

# 3 A small excursion to design notes
But if you would ask me right now, how this is to be done EXACTLY, I would scratch my head. This is why we still need to add in some details to the Phase's description and maybe some diagrams to be sure that I actually understand what I am doing. 

This is why I am working with the concept of design notes. So for each Phase and for each Milestone, I add the context (just some short description) and some design (usually this can be called architecture). I also add in here the requirements which are related to the current task at hand. Now that I have all the information at hand, I can get started with the implementation.
