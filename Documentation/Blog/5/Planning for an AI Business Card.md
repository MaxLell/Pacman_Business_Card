In the [[How I do the planning by looking at the problem from different angles|previous]] article I talked about the different approaches to break down the problem. This section is about applying it to the business card.

As mentioned before, I will not go through all the aspects - since not all are relevant for the task at hand. (At least for this stage)
# 1 Applied to the business card

## 1.1 Looks
The card will look like this. It is handy, it is small, I can carry multiple of them and it looks so amazing that everybody is going to love it! What an "eye-candy"!

## 1.2 Interaction
This captures how the different users might interact with the device. I usually write them in a short-story form. I imagine how the user might interact with the device. These are the [[UC - Index|Use Cases]]. From that I learn which features are necessary at that point. For example I learned that I need a Power-Button that won't be triggered by accident when the person holds the card with its left hand. 

## 1.3 WHY does it do, what it shall do?
This adds an extra layer of understanding why the user might need a feature. I usually write these in the form of [[US - Index|User Stories]]. Often while writing these User Stories, I realize how ridiculous and useless some of the imagined features are. So I remove them. Following this entire process also helps me to understand what the device is NOT about.

## 1.4 Wait WHAT?
In addition to the previous considerations, I also add a table of Requirements. This sums up just what I need to build in a technical sense. These are written that I understand what it is that needs to be implemented in a technical sense. For example it is not sufficient to know, that the device needs a battery and that this is needed so that the device can be shown off directly on a tradeshow. What I need to know as an engineer is for example how many "mAh" the battery has! Otherwise I can't select components and build it.

## 1.5 Diagrams
Sometimes I need to create a couple of diagrams in order to understand what the system is all about. So on a system level I create a couple of diagrams. Again by drawing these diagrams you can learn a lot about the system.
