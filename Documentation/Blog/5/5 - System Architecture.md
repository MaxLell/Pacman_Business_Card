# Architecture
Architecture is a very vague term. There can be a lot of formality, but for me architecture is a visual aid to understand the system that I am working with. It helps me to explain to myself how the system is supposed to work in a much simpler version then code for example. 

There is no single architecture diagram that you need. Rather then that you shine light on the technical product from different angles (like watching a cube from different perspectives). 
For example for this matter here - I am creating a system architecture: 
- A block diagram which shows me the High Level components that are involved with this business card

- I create a software architecture in which I will describe all the interfaces and physical interfaces (libraries) that I will need to interface to.

- I create a flow chart for the different scenarios of the system entering low-power modes

- I create context diagrams for modules exchanging data with each other.

- I create state-machine diagrams for when the system changes its internal states, what triggers them ...

Anyway the point here is: I am developing these diagrams, as I need them. And of course they also need to be maintained, when a change rolls in. You will find that the diagrams that are really useful are looked up at a very regular basis. Therefore it makes sense to also keep them updated.

However for the current time being, I will not go into all the details on how to develop these diagram. At the moment, the major Idea I want to transmit: System / Software / Hardware Architecture is an intermediate output that helps you to understand the system you are working with in a graphical way. Doodle as much as you need in order to understand what you need to develop in the next steps. Architecture has NO intrinsic value. It is a tool to clarify your thoughts, but it is not an output. An output would be the working system. This is to be kept in mind. 

Besides this architecture also serves the long-term purpose to make the system faster to grasp. So for long-term maintenance it makes sense to have the project well documented and then you can count the architecture into the documentation field. So then there is some real value in that.
