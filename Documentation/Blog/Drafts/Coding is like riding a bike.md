Have you ever heard of the sentence: "Weeks of coding can save you hours of planning". Jumping straight into implementation feels good! You are covering ground and you get to show some results early. You see the Led blink and the motor spinning. What you are not seeing is the rising complexity that is added with every feature. It feels great at the moment, until you find yourself in the following circumstance:

> Coding is like riding a bike. Except the bike is on fire, you are on fire, everything is on fire, because you are in hell

Eventually as every new addition of a new feature takes more time and you already had several rewrites of you code base, you realize that you borrowed time from the future by not doing the planning phase properly.

When I was just starting out, I was working on a project where we skipped the planning phase for the sake of making ground quickly. 

I jumped right into development. The LEDs blinked, the motors were spinning. After a couple of months, I was confronted with many situations like these: 
- A transistor is no longer working? Hmmm - it also feels kind of hot when I touch it? Where is that coming from? 
- Enabling this pin, made the Magic Smoke come out of the Microcontroller? What? Why is the 12V Power Supply directly applied to this input pin?
- How is this global variable enabled? Why is this such a spaghetti code?
- Yet another manual test run? I am not doing that, it takes way too much time ...

We treated a complex system as a 

As you can see - these are all clearly signs of low-quality performance.
Eventually we blew the schedule and the budget and the project was canceled.

A very good thing we did afterwards was sitting together and licking our wounds. We figured that a lot of the issues would have been avoidable, if we would have planned it out more thoroughly and prioritized accordingly. A lot of the features that we were pouring so much energy in, were only optional.

In the next project we focused more on planning and it became a success. We were burned and we learned.
