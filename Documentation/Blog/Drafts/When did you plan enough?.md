TLDR: How to avoid running into a black hole of planning

# 1 Overdoing Requirements and waiting for the perfect plan
In one project that I was working in, the team obsessed over perfect planning - meaning requirements, architecture and scheduling. At the end we had no "perfect" plan and we were producing nothing. But we were feeling very productive and spinning very fast in our circle.

This is definitely something that I would like to avoid here. For this project, I will not put emphasis of a perfect plan (because I can tell you that takes ages), but rather I am approaching this project with optimistic naivety (at least to some degree). What I found in the past, is that you create way more tangible feedback for you project when you actually go and implement stuff, rather then thinking it through. By doing so, you evade the premature optimization trap that you can also fall into, when feedback comes only very late in the project.

On the other hand, I also made the experience, that when you have no planning at all, it really goes along this famous quote: "Weeks of coding can save you hours of planning". In the past I already had situations where I was jumping from one idea to the next, without some criteria to evaluate these ideas against (requirements are such a boundary).

# 2 Where is the middle ground to be found?
So where is the middle ground to be found?

Good question - it really depends. "Great what a useful answer ... :D". 

# 3 The ends to good planning
The ends to good planning is:
1. Know enough about the overall direction you are walking
2. Know enough so that you can progress for the upcoming month
3. You can start right away with implementing stuff and capture some real-life feedback. Your initial assumptions might be wrong after all - time to find out as quickly as possible.
