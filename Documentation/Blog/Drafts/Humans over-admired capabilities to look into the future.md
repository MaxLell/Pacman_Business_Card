What I found: There is a lot of emphasis on perfect planning in my industry. Look at Jira and how they push to you that you need to organize EVERYTHING so that you do not miss anything. 

But this is not how stuff is actually made. What these companies do not tell you: It takes significant effort, time and costs in order to have the perfectly organized system.

Back in the day, I was writing extensive diaries and I also wanted to bring some structure into my writings, because people showed online the "Bullet Journal Method" and how they got so much more done, because they were so incredibly organized. What they did not say was how much effort it takes to stick to such a system, to maintain all these different lists. I tried it and I always fell off, because it was just so much EFFORT. Effort you are spending without actually producing something.
