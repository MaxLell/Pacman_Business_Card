The way I understand it is that Architecture is really only a byproduct to understand the technical behaviour much better.

Same as Product designers are sketching physical products to understand better how the product they are currently designing might work eventually, we engineers are also using these plots to better understand and develop the technical intricacies that make our product.

For the sake of keeping it short - these are the plots that I generated for the Pacman AI Card. 

# 1 System Block Diagram

# 2 Software

## 2.1 Block Diagram

## 2.2 Data Flow Diagram

## 2.3 Pseudo Code

## 2.4 Data Architecture

# 3 Electronic Block Diagram

# 4 Mechanical Sketch

I could do many more of these architecture plots, but the target is not to do ALL the schemes there are, but just to do enough to get a good understanding of the overall system.
